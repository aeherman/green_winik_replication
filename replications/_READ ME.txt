This directory contains 7 Stata .do files, one for each replicated paper, except that the Kuziemko and Ganong replications are combined into one file.
These should be the starting point for any exploration.

All .png and .doc files are generated by the do files.

IJIVE regressions in the Levitt reanalysis require that makejive.ado and lmakejive.mlib be in a place visible to Stata, such as C:\ado\plus.
